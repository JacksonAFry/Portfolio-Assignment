    <h2 class="module"> Intro to JS </h2>
    <p>  
        This moudule was m very first look into JavaScript. Although a lot of the basics were quite similar to other languages, there were some differences that I had to get used to. For example, strict equality (===). Khan Academy's Intro to JS course was also my first experience with object oriented design, which was a very different method than I've used before. 
    </p>
  
  
  <h2 class="module"> Intro to HTML/CSS </h2>
    <p>  
          Although this module was not my first look into HTML or CSS, it definately further enhanced my understanding of the syntax and common practices and it taught me the information i needed to complete this portfolio website. The project "<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/css-layout-properties/pp/project-event-invite">Event Invite</a>" definately was one of the more useful pieces of this module as it was a good way to check my understanding of all the concepts used, such as: <ul>
    <li>Lists</li>
    <li>CSS styling</li>
    <li>Including images</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    </p>

    
    <h2 class="module"> Advanced Games and Visualizations </h2>
    <p>  
        This module took the basics from Intro to JS and expanded on them which made me a much more compitant developer.

    <h2 class="module"> Creative Coding Session </h2>
    <p>  
        The creative coding challenges were a very good way to learn more about JavaScript. Maro and I decided to do "The Game of Life". For me, making the presentation and following along with the other presentations definately taught me a lot. By watching the videos made by <a href="https://shiffman.net/" target="_blank">Daniel Shiffman</a>, I learned more about the process of getting your idea, plaaning, and creating the program. I also refactored another group's flappy bird project where I edited the game to include hurtzones at the top and bottom of the canvas as well as some visual changes. <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/jfry1/sketches/_qGDhNaaQ" target="_blank">Link to p5.js Editor. </a>
