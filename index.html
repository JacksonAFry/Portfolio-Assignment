    <h2 class="module"> Intro to JS </h2>
    <p>  
        This moudule was m very first look into JavaScript. Although a lot of the basics were quite similar to other languages, there were some differences that I had to get used to. For example, strict equality (===). Khan Academy's Intro to JS course was also my first experience with object oriented design, which was a very different method than I've used before. 
    </p>
  
  
  <h2 class="module"> Intro to HTML/CSS </h2>
    <p>  
          Although this module was not my first look into HTML or CSS, it definately further enhanced my understanding of the syntax and common practices and it taught me the information I needed to complete this portfolio website. The project "<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/css-layout-properties/pp/project-event-invite">Event Invite</a>" definately was one of the more useful pieces of this module as it was a good way to check my understanding of all the concepts used, such as: <ul>
    <li>Lists</li>
    <li>CSS styling</li>
    <li>Including images</li>
    </ul>
    I can use what I learned in this module to produce better Github pages in future.
    
    </p>

    
    <h2 class="module"> Advanced Games and Visualizations </h2>
    <p>  
        This module took the basics from Intro to JS and expanded on them which made me a much more compitant developer. The projects had the student read through the code and make changes or additions, which gave me a bit more of a sense of what developing programs with others would be like. The projects in this catagory also made me do more planning beforehand, which was useful for other modules I completed in this course.
    </p>

    
    <h2 class="module"> Advanced JS: Natural Simulations </h2>
    <p>  
        Advanced JS: Natural Simulations was an extremely useful module. It gave me the information I would need to create more realistic programs, with different types of noise and randomness. The module also went into detail about motion and forces which would allow for more realistic simulations. 
    </p>


    <h2 class="module"> Computer Science Principles: Programming </h2>
    <p>  
        This module served as a very good review for computer science concepts such as conditionals, loops, and variables. It may not have taught me anything I did not already know, however it was a good module to get back into computer science with. This module was also my first experience with Khan Academy, making me more familiar with their systems. 
    </p>
    

    <h2 class="module"> Computer Science Principles: Digital Information and Algorithms </h2>
    <p>  
        The digital informations portion of this module taught me more about how compputers store and use data, while the algorithms portion was more focussed on creating more efficient and acurate algorithms. There wasn't one portion of the module that stood out as more important than the rest as it was all information that i could use in the future. For example, the information on copyright isn't any more important than the different aspects of an algortithm. It was all very useful information that I will most likely end up using in the future.
    </p>
  
    
    
    <h2 class="module"> Git 'N' Going </h2>
    <p>  
        This module was my first experience with Github. The Github learning labs in this module all explained how Github works, which will be useful for contributing in open source projects as well as making portfolios or other web pages using Github pages. Github and other version control systems are used a lot in computer science, so it would make sense to learn how to use it now rather than later.  
    </p>    
    
    
    <h2 class="module"> Cubing Workflow </h2>
    <p>  
        This module gave me the opportunity to explore the use of markdown syntax. Cubing is also quite similar to computer science as well. You start with a certain state and have to apply various algorithms is varous orders to solve the issue (a scambled cube in this case). Another similarity to computer science is that differnt people will come up with different methods to solve the issue, sometimes using similar algorithms just in different ways.
    </p>    
    
    
    <h2 class="module"> Free Code Camp: Basic HTML and HTML5 </h2>
    <p>  
        Free Code Camp was my favorite learning tool I used this year. The Basic HTML and HTML5 module had very similar information to Khan Academy's Intro to HTML/CSS, however I found it to be much more engaging. If I keep working on computer science outside of a classroom, I would most likely use Free Code Camp as it took me much less time to understand the concepts introduced.

    </p>        
    
    
    <h2 class="module"> Creative Coding Session </h2>
    <p>  
        The creative coding challenges were a very good way to learn more about JavaScript. Maro and I decided to do "The Game of Life". For me, making the presentation and following along with the other presentations definately taught me a lot. By watching the videos made by <a href="https://shiffman.net/" target="_blank">Daniel Shiffman</a>, I learned more about the process of getting your idea, plaaning, and creating the program. I also refactored another group's flappy bird project where I edited the game to include hurtzones at the top and bottom of the canvas as well as some visual changes. <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/jfry1/sketches/_qGDhNaaQ" target="_blank">Link to p5.js Editor. </a>
